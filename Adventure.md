A text adventure game is a video game in which textual descriptions and choices are the primary means of interaction. In a text adventure game, players read descriptions, select options, and enter commands to advance the plot of the game. Typically, text adventure games are set in fictional worlds in which players take on the role of characters who embark on adventures, solving puzzles, exploring maps, interacting with the characters, and influencing the story's progression and ending.

Text adventure games emphasise the player's imagination and decision-making skills, as the plot and story of the game are usually presented through text rather than through graphics and animation. This style of gameplay allows players to immerse themselves in a rich storyline while also encouraging them to think and solve problems.

Classic text adventure games include Zork, Adventure, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, while modern text adventure games include 80 Days, Sorcery! and the Choice of Games series.
