A **text adventure** game is a video game in which textual descriptions and choices are the primary means of interaction. In a text adventure game, players read descriptions, select options, and enter commands to advance the plot of the game. Typically, text adventure games are set in fictional worlds in which players take on the role of characters who embark on adventures, solving puzzles, exploring maps, interacting with the characters, and influencing the story's progression and ending.

Text adventure games emphasise **the player's imagination and decision-making skills**, as the plot and story of the game are usually presented through text rather than through graphics and animation. This style of gameplay allows players to immerse themselves in a rich storyline while also encouraging them to think and solve problems.

**Classic** text adventure games include Zork, Adventure, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

MyOwnStory
---

So I decided to make my own text adventure game, and for the theme I chose a fictional world where you can see magic, werewolves, vampires and other classic western fantasy elements.


Introduction to the story outline
---


This is a text adventure game in a fictional and overhead world where magic, the Society for the Administration of Magic, the Church of Vampire Hunting, vampires, werewolves, and others fantasies elements exist and sneakily lurk right into human society. The story all starts eight years ago, when the protagonist Aaron Einzbern's parents suddenly disappeared. And at the tender age of eight, he was sent by the police to his grandfather's house in the countryside. During a chance encounter in the countryside he discovers a mysterious tomb, and then accidentally acquires some kind of mysterious power, but of course he doesn't know how to use it. In the process of using this power, he was injured by himself and lost his memory, and then was adopted by a distant relative. 16 years old, he became an ordinary high school student, and on a hot afternoon, he walked into an old street that he had never been to before. When he enters a dilapidated opera house, he suddenly finds an unconscious girl, and as he walks in the girl suddenly attacks him, and in order to protect himself he goes on a rampage and loses his mind and falls into a coma. The next day he finds the girl standing in front of him unharmed, and is told that the girl's identity is actually the legendary vampire, and his fate has changed from this day.

Process
---

Creating a Twine word game has been an easy and fun process for me, although there have been a number of missteps along the way. Firstly, I decided to define the theme and basic plot of my game, and then created a new project in Twine. Next, I began to start building the main game thread and major branches. When adding nodes, I created connections for each choice and made sure that each choice led the player in a different direction. Finally, add text content and descriptions, as well as possible plot developments and endings. There were also a lot of screw-ups, for example, I accidentally lost the archive so I had to start from scratch, of course I didn't even know how to post the pictures at first, and in the middle I learnt how to set up the variables for blood, magic power, and experience (as shown in the picture), and in general I feel that I could have done a much better job with the project and made it much more comprehensive, but due to the tight timeframe, I just had to But due to time constraints, I could only make this semi-finished product, and I hope that in the future, I can have the chance to make a real text adventure game.
