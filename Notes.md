**NFTs** are a scam, it is similar to cryptocurrencies, just like a euro has a value that has been previously given by society. On the other hand, crypto is a type of speculative currency, speculated to have a value in the future, not in the present. Transacting cryptocurrencies with another person will mean that the operation will be public, unlike in a bank, in which case it will be private. There can only be a total of 15 transactions executed in the whole world in a single second, during which the processor will start to solve a puzzle and put them in a queue to realize the transaction.

**Cryptocurrency** is a trading medium which uses cryptographic principles to secure transactions and control the creation of trading units. Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that do not rely on a centralized national bank, but instead depend on speculation and incentives to determine their value. This makes cryptocurrencies extremely volatile, having experienced crashes and spikes.

Blockchain technology is an innovative way of storing information in a database. Its applications are very diverse and are still being discovered and developed. 

The actions taken to add data to a blockchain are known as **transactions**. The content of these transactions can be diverse and are generally determined by the type of network in use. Some blockchains allow, through transactions, to upload digital files to the register.


In Bitcoin's case, each unit is **fungible**. This means that a Bitcoin is fully interchangeable for another Bitcoin with no significant difference between them in terms of value or utility.

**Fungible**:It is defined by the dictionary as **‚Äúeasy to exchange or trade for something else of the same type and value‚Äù**Ôºåand from an economic point of view, it means this item and the other have the same economic value. For example, a bar of 100% pure gold and another piece of gold of the same weight and the same purity have the same value.

**Extra:** While when I was searching for information, I found a very interesting thing, about fourteen years ago in 2010, a man in the United States used 10,000 bitcoins to buy two pizzas, and this amount of money is now hundreds of thousands of times, so he became a legend, but we can also see that the instability of the bitcoin as well as potential<img width="720" alt="Êà™Â±è2024-03-12 21 31 58" src="https://github.com/ahong2006/VideoGames/assets/124577520/cf72db4d-1b5d-4e6c-839f-88ea4d49f0ce">

**Mining** is the process of validating and processing cryptocurrency transactions by solving complex mathematical problems.

1. **Validate Transactions:** Verify and validate the transactions to be processed.
1. **Create Block:** Package the validated transactions into a block, containing a set of transaction records and the previous block's hash value.
1. **Solve Mathematical Problem:** Attempt to solve a complex mathematical problem, known as Proof of Work, by finding a hash value within a specific range.
1. **Find Correct Hash:** Continuously try different numbers to find the correct hash value that meets the criteria.
1. **Broadcast Block:** Once the correct hash value is found, broadcast the new block to the entire network.
1. **Reward and Confirmation:** Receive cryptocurrency rewards for successful mining, and confirm the transactions in the new block by adding them to the blockchain.

**Hash**:Usually represented by a short string of random letters and digits, it is a set of arbitrary length of the input information through the hash algorithm to get the "data fingerprint", that is, the encryption algorithm to get a set of binary values, since the computer in the underlying machine code is used in binary mode.
