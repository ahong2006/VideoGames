## Class Notes🎬:





### *🏎️NFT🏎️(Non-Fungible Token)*
___

The **NFT** are a scam, it is similar to cryptocurrencies, just like a euro has a value that has been previously given by a society. On the other hand, cryptocurrencies are a type of speculation, speculated to have a value in the future, not in the present but in the future. Passing cryptocurrencies to another person will mean that the transaction will be public, not as in a bank, which will be private. At the second only a total of 15 transactions can be made on the entire planet, the processor starts to solve a puzzle and puts them in a queue to make the transaction.

### *BlockChain🚝( Blockchain.com )🚝*
___
**Cryptocurrencies** are digital currencies that do not rely on a centralized national bank, but instead rely on speculation and incentives to determine their value. This makes cryptocurrencies extremely volatile, having experienced crashes and spikes.

Blockchain technology, also known as **blockchain** in English, is an innovative way of storing information in a database. Its applications are very diverse and are still in the process of discovery and development. 

The actions taken to add data to a blockchain are known as **transactions**. The content of these transactions can be diverse and is generally determined by the type of network in use. Some blockchains allow, through transactions, digital files to be uploaded to the registry.


In the case of Bitcoin, each Bitcoin unit is **fungible**. This means that one Bitcoin is fully interchangeable for another Bitcoin with no significant difference between them in terms of value or utility.

**Mining** is the process of validating and processing cryptocurrency transactions by solving complex mathematical problems.

1. **Validate Transactions:** Verify and validate the transactions to be processed.
1. **Create Block:** Package the validated transactions into a block, containing a set of transaction records and the previous block's hash value.
1. **Solve Mathematical Problem:** Attempt to solve a complex mathematical problem, known as Proof of Work, by finding a hash value within a specific range.
1. **Find Correct Hash:** Continuously try different numbers to find the correct hash value that meets the criteria.
1. **Broadcast Block:** Once the correct hash value is found, broadcast the new block to the entire network.
1. **Reward and Confirmation:** Receive cryptocurrency rewards for successful mining, and confirm the transactions in the new block by adding them to the blockchain.
